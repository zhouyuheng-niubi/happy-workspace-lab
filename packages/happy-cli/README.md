# Happy

Code on the go — control AI coding agents from your phone, browser, or terminal.

Free. Open source. Code anywhere.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g happy
```

> Migrated from the `happy-coder` package. Thanks to [@franciscop](https://github.com/franciscop) for donating the `happy` package name!

## Usage

### Claude Code (default)

```bash
happy
# or
happy claude
```

This will:
1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Display a QR code to connect from your mobile device or browser
3. Allow real-time session control — all communication is end-to-end encrypted
4. Start new sessions directly from your phone or web while your computer is online

### More agents

```
happy codex
happy gemini
happy openclaw

# or any ACP-compatible CLI
happy acp opencode
happy acp -- custom-agent --flag
```

## Daemon

The daemon is a background service that stays running on your machine. It lets you spawn and manage coding sessions remotely — from your phone or the web app — without needing an open terminal.

```bash
happy daemon start
happy daemon stop
happy daemon status
happy daemon list
```

The daemon starts automatically when you run `happy`, so you usually don't need to manage it manually.

## Authentication

```bash
happy auth login
happy auth logout
```

Happy uses cryptographic key pairs for authentication — your private key stays on your machine. All session data is end-to-end encrypted before leaving your device.

To connect third-party agent APIs:

```bash
happy connect gemini
happy connect claude
happy connect codex
happy connect status
```
